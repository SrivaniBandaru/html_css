DOM means Document Object Model. complete your html will be stored by browser inside one object called "document" . it will store in a tree structure called "DOM tree".

To manipulate DOM using JS.
1. selectors
2. events
3. manipulators

1. selectors:
There are different ways to select a dom element in JS.

getElementsByTagName('p')----> it will select all paragraph elements.

getElementsByClassName('classname')----> it will select all elements of that particular class 

getElementById('idname') --> select only one element with that id 

**** tagname and classname results a HTML Collection, array

similarly you can also use
document.querySelector('query') --> select the first element that satisfies the following query..

to select all elements you can use document.querySelectorAll('query')
